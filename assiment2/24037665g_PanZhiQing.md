## (1) How many unique taxis are there in this dataset, and how many trips are recorded?

- Before cleaning the data:
    ``` 
    Number of unique taxis: 13200
    Number of trips recorded: 33983783
    ```

- If we use the following principles to clean the data:
    - Remove the rows with invalid values(like the pick-up or drop-off time is not a valid unixtime, or bad lines)
    - Remove the rows out of the time window [2010-12-31 00:00:00, current time at the script running]
    - Remove the rows with the same pick-up and drop-off locations
    - Remove the rows with the same pick-up and drop-off time
    - Remove the rows with the drop-off time earlier than the pick-up time
    - Remove the rows with the pick-up or drop-off locations not in the intersection.csv

- After cleaning the data:
    ``` 
    Number of unique taxis: 13180
    Number of trips recorded: 33564235
    ```

## (2) What is the distribution of the number of trips per taxi? Who are the top performers?
The top performer is taxi 2960, which has 4979 trips.

The distribution of the number of trips per taxi is as follows:

ï½œname|taxi_id|count|
|---|---|---|
|min|12817, 12069, 13239, 10726|1|
|25%|9736|1924|
|50%|6646|2732|
|75%|6015|3291|
|max|2960|4979|

We can use boxplot to show the distribution of the number of trips per taxi.

For the whole distribution, we can use histogram to show the distribution of the number of trips per taxi. We can find that the main distribution obays the normal distribution roughly.

## (3) How does the daily trip count (i.e., number of trips per day) change throughout the year? Any rhythm or seasonality?

## (4) What is the distribution of the number of departure trips at different locations (i.e., intersections)? What about the distribution of arrival trips? What will you conclude from these two distributions?

## (5) How does the number of trips change over time in a day? (You will be given three dates randomly selected from the dataset, and then plot the hourly variation of trips from the perspective of local time).

## (6) What is the probability distribution of the trip distance (measured as straight-line distance)? How about travel time (i.e., trip duration)? What will you conclude from these two distributions?
