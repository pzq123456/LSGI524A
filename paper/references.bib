    abstract = { Growing concerns about global motorization and climate change have led to increasing interest in sustainable transportation alternatives such as bikesharing (the shared use of a bicycle fleet). Since 1965, bikesharing has grown across the globe on five continents: Europe, North America, South America, Asia, and Australia. Today, approximately 100 bikesharing programs are operating in an estimated 125 cities, with more than 139,300 bicycles. Bikesharing's evolution is categorized into three generations: (a) white bikes (or free bike systems), (b) coin-deposit systems, and (c) information technology-based systems. In this paper, a fourth generation is proposed: demand-responsive, multimodal systems. A range of existing bikesharing business models (e.g., advertising) and lessons learned are discussed, including (a) bicycle theft and vandalism, (b) bicycle redistribution, (c) information systems (e.g., real-time information), (d) insurance and liability concerns, and (e) prelaunch considerations. Although limited in number, several studies have documented bikesharing's social and environmental benefits, which include reduced auto use, increased bicycle use, and a growing awareness of bikesharing as a daily mobility option. Despite bike-sharing's ongoing growth, obstacles and uncertainty remain: these include future demand, safety, sustainability of business models, limited cycling infrastructure, challenges to integrate with public transportation systems, technology costs, and user convenience (e.g., limited height adjustment on bicycles, lack of cargo space, and exposure to weather). More research is needed for a better understanding of bikesharing's effects, operations, and business models in light of its reported growth and benefits. }

    abstract = {This study quantifies the motivators and barriers to bikeshare program usage in Australia. An online survey was administered to a sample of annual members of Australia’s two bikeshare programs based in Brisbane and Melbourne, to assess motivations for joining the schemes. Non-members of the programs were also sampled in order to identify current barriers to joining bikeshare. Spatial analysis from Brisbane revealed residential and work locations of non-members were more geographically dispersed than for bikeshare members. An analysis of bikeshare usage in Melbourne showed a strong relationship between docking stations in areas with relatively less accessible public transit opportunities. The most influential barriers to bikeshare use related to motorized travel being too convenient and docking stations not being sufficiently close to home, work and other frequented destinations. The findings suggest that bikeshare programs may attract increased membership by ensuring travel times are competitive with motorized travel, for example through efficient bicycle routing and priority progression and, by expanding docking station locations, and by increasing the level of convenience associated with scheme use. Convenience considerations may include strategic location of docking stations, ease of signing up and integration with public transport.}

Two bicycle innovations, electric bikes, and public bikesharing (the shared use of a bicycle fleet), are also explored in this article. Electric bikes could provide a transitional mode on the pathway to bicycle and public transportation integration or to small battery electric cars. Four lessons have been learned from China's electric bike experience relevant to government policy and management. Public bikesharing represents an important step towards integrating the bicycle with bus, metro, and rail systems. Five early operational lessons have been identified from China's limited public bikesharing experience. }

    abstract = {Since the first Bike Sharing System (BSS) was introduced in Amsterdam (1965), studies about BSSs have constantly increased. BSSs studies are typically focused on user's socio-economic characteristics, bike sharing patterns and purpose of use in the city. This paper increases the knowledge of bike station classification due to users' mobility patterns based on data mining tools. For this purpose stations will be identified by a code based on joining three ratios: the load factor or number of available bikes ratio, the cumulative trips ratio, and the turnover station ratio. The latter is the new ratio proposed in this paper, which measures the effectiveness degree of each station. The higher the rate, the more effective the station is. Data mining tools to work with these three ratios are used in the proposed algorithm. Specifically, the perceptually important points (PIP) process to represent and index each time series of each station, and a rule set to classify the stations, are used. The results could support planning and operations decisions for re-design and management of BSSs in relation to the spatial implications of the stations and the users' mobility patterns, due to the classification reveals imbalances in the distribution of bikes and lead to a better understanding of the system structure. The proposed method is applied to the Dublin Bikes Scheme with good performance results.}

    abstract = {Public Bicycle Sharing Programs (PBSPs) have become a prominent feature across city spaces worldwide. In less than a decade, PBSPs have grown from a small number of European cities to include five continents and in excess of 200 schemes. Despite the rapid rise of this new transport opportunity, there has been limited research on the underlying dynamics of these schemes, arguably reflecting a lack of detailed data available to researchers. The current paper redresses the observed deficit using trip level data from Brisbane’s ‘CityCycle’, the largest PBSP in Australia. These data provide an opportunity to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of a large PBSP system, specifically the effects of weather and calendar events on the geographic and temporal patterning of public bicycle use. Employing novel spatial analytical techniques we explore the impact of site specific weather conditions and calendar events on the spatio-temporal dynamics of the case study PBSP. We conclude by highlighting how the results from such analyses may form part of an evidence base for policy makers, providing insights into ‘best practice’ and potentially informing future PBSP expansions to further enhance uptake of this non-motorised urban transport mode.}
