## Components
- Assignments (20% + 20%)
    - Two assignments are designed for students to clean, preprocess, and analyze open datasets through the usage of Python (assignment 1) and their preferred programming languages or tools (assignment 2).

- Class Projects (60%)
    - Type: Group Project
    - Each group (3 students) is required to conduct a research project to tackle a specific research challenge tied to cities & big data.
    - The project needs to involve data analytics; A simple review or discussion paper is NOT allowed.
    - Assessment methods: project report & in-class presentation. 

- In-class presentation for group projects
  - For group projects, student are expected to conduct literature review
  and data collection at the early stage (from week3).
  - Student groups will be asked to deliver a presentation during week 7
  and week 8 to share their research plan (e.g., topic selected, literature
  review, data collection, and design of methodology).
  - Final project presentation will be arranged during week 12 and week
  13.
